> HDFS_INFO

  Allow testing of file/folder existence. And retrieve owner, group and mode of an existing file/folder on HDFS.

Options (= is mandatory):

- hadoop_conf_dir
        Where to find Haddop configuration file, specially hdfs-site.xml, in order to lookup WebHDFS endpoint (`dfs.namenode
        .http-address') Used only if webhdfs_endpoint is not defined
        [Default: /etc/hadoop/conf]
= hdfs_path
        HDFS path to the file being managed.  Aliases: `dest', `name'
        [Default: None]
- hdfs_user
        Define account to impersonate to perform required operation on HDFS through WebHDFS.
        Also accepts the special value `KERBEROS'. In such case, a valid Kerberos ticket must exist for the ansible_user
        account. (A `kinit' must be issued under this account). Then HDFS operation will be performed on behalf of the user
        defined by the Kerberos ticket.
        [Default: hdfs]
- webhdfs_endpoint
        Provide WebHDFS REST API entry point. Typically `<namenodeHost>:50070'. It could also be a comma separated list of entry
        point, which will be checked up to a valid one. This will allow Namenode H.A. handling. If not defined, will be looked
        up in local hdfs-site.xml
        [Default: None]
Notes:
  * As HDFS is a distributed file system shared by all nodes of a cluster, this module must be launched on one node only.
        Note there is no protection against race condition (Same operation performed simultaneously from several nodes).
  * All HDFS operations are performed using WebHDFS REST API.

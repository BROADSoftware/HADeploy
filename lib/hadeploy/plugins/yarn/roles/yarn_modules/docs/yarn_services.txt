> YARN_SERVICES    

  Allow to fetch yarn jobs status, to wait for up or down state and to kill jobs, based on jobs name.

Options (= is mandatory):

- hadoop_conf_dir
        Where to find Hadoop configuration file, specially yarn-site.xml, in order to lookup ressource manager web endpoint
        (`yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address[.rm1|.rm2]') Used only if rm_endpoints is not defined
        [Default: /etc/hadoop/conf]
- kerberos
        Boolean. Storm UI access require kerberos authentication
        [Default: False]
= names
        A comma separated list of job names to control
        [Default: None]
- rm_endpoint
        Provide Yarn REST API entry point. Typically `<namenodeHost>:8088'. It could also be a comma separated list of entry
        point, which will be checked up to a valid one. This will allow resource manager H.A. handling. If not defined, will be
        looked up in local yarn-site.xml
        [Default: None]
= state
        target job state: `RUNNING', `killed', `nonexistent', `existing', `get'
        `RUNNING': Wait for all jobs to be in RUNNING state. Also, can exit on timeout, or when detecting a failing job.
        `killed': Issue a kill command if yarn job is RUNNING (or starting). If not, or already in `killed' state, do nothing.
        Exit immediately.
        `nonexistent': Wait for all jobs to be not RUNNING.
        `get': Do nothing. Return current jobs status
        [Default: None]
- timeout
        Timeout value when waiting a target state
        [Default: 120]
Notes:
  * All operations are performed using Ressource Manager web REST API
  * This module is intended to manage a list of jobs as a whole.
